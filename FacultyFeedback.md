# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 2 - Jan 18 ##

## Week 3 - Jan 25 ##

## Week 4 - Feb 1 ##
- Your problem statements are essentially the same.  Each statement should identify a different problem.
- Too much irrelevant detail in personas
- Please add SCRUM Lead schedule to Working Agreement

## Week 5 - Feb 8 ##
 - You are mobbing too much and it slows you down. Each person should have a story that they own and are working on each week.
 - When faculty visits (facilitator assigned for the week opens the Kanban board and filters on each person). Each team member takes one minute to talk about the work
item they finished, and what work item they are working on. Their should be very little "we" and mostly "I" in explaining completed stories
- Branching policies! Nice!
## Week 6 - Feb 15 ##
- Navja's mic didn't work
- Good Kanban board hygiene: ie: it is up to date when I drop in. Love that you are good about closing completed work items/stories
- Each work item / user story should have detailed description and acceptance criteria/checklist so you know what "done" looks like. Lots of team members
are missing acceptance criteria

## Week 7 - Feb 22 ##

- Work items in the "done" column but still being worked on.  Either move to "active" or create new work item for balance of work remaining
- No description or acceptance criteria in stories by anyone on team Need to fix
- Maryam did work but no story
- Work Item #4 too many on one story (mobbing); need to break up into one-story per person!
